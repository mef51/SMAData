This polarization observation can begin at 
17:30 HST (03:30 UT) and will do this: HST Event 
17:30 Start script. It goes to 3c454.3 (bandpass/polarization cal) 
19:30 Callisto (flux cal) 
19:35 3c454.3 (bandpass/polarization cal) 
23:10 Target loop on IKTau (0423-013 gain cal) 
00:20 3c454.3 (bandpass/polarization cal) 
00:50 Target loop on IKTau (0423-013 gain cal) 
01:35 3c454.3 (bandpass/polarization cal) 
01:50 Target loop on IKTau (0423-013 gain cal) 
08:10 Gain cal sets below el limit. Kill script after gain cal.

action taken:	
03:00 	adosaj 	Observing 1924-292 while we wait for script start time and 3c454.3 to rise.
03:26 	adosaj 	Pushing script start back by 20-30 mins as per Ram's request.
03:51 	adosaj 	Script started.
04:00 	rhowie 	We arrived at the summit and drove around the array. We found nothing that would impede movement of the antennas.
04:08 	rhowie 	I took over running polar and the script.
05:08 	rhowie 	I killed the script and polar to ipoint -m -i 32 on 3c454.3.
05:19 	rhowie 	The offsets were consistent and accepted: Average: Ant 1 AzOff = -14.5 ElOff = 5.9 deltaAz = -2.6 deltaEl = -1.2 Ant 2 AzOff = -3.7 ElOff = 7.4 deltaAz = -5.7 deltaEl = -8.3 Ant 3 AzOff = -2.9 ElOff = 8.1 deltaAz = -1.3 deltaEl = -2.7 Ant 5 AzOff = -3.1 ElOff = 8.0 deltaAz = -4.2 deltaEl = -4.9 Ant 6 AzOff = 5.0 ElOff = 4.5 deltaAz = 4.1 deltaEl = -3.6 Ant 7 AzOff = -3.6 ElOff = 6.4 deltaAz = 3.9 deltaEl = -5.5 Ant 8 AzOff = -4.8 ElOff = 4.1 deltaAz = -1.4 deltaEl = -11.3
05:19 	rhowie 	I started polar and the script.

details:	I forgot to switch the scans back to 15 seconds after the correlator restart.
action taken:	I killed polar and the script. integrate -t 15 I restarted polar and the script.

12:08 	sfyen 	Sheng-Feng and Chun-Hui took over from IAA.
18:02 	sfyen 	Kill the script when gain cal and run full polarization pattern on 0423-013 according to Ram's instrction.
18:18 	sfyen 	The acc8 spontaneous antenna reboot when I type command stow. I will reboot and stow. Thank Ram hlep to lock it for EndObs.
18:32 	sfyen 	Run EndObs and EndProject.
